# Automating-erp-iitkgp-negative-feedback
This is a modified version of the script written by @grapheo12. Let that frustration out(although no one reads feedbacks lol).

To use, copy the contents of the negativeFeedback.js file in this repo and paste it in then console of your browser after opening the feedback page of a particular prof.
Press Enter and voila!

For now, it works only for theory courses, not lab courses.
